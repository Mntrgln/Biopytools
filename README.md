## About this repo:
These are the python scripts that I developed to help me and my laboratory collaborators with our work, almost all of them handles inputs and/or information for other bioinformatics tools.
I'm aiming on standarize these scripts to use them with Nextflow DSL, and make them more acessible for other users. If you woul'd like to discuss any changes or ask me anything about these scripts, fell free to send my an email or open an issue here, I'm open to collaborations.

## Requirements:

* python verion > 3.6
* python Bio package
` just that :D`
